# TM Forum MTOSI / MTNM / MTOP examples

For an explanation of MTOSI / MTNM / MTOP history see
https://www.tmforum.org/standards/standarized-interfaces-apis/a-little-bit-of-history/

Basically MTOSI is a web services based version of MTNM which was beased on CORBA.

The full specs and supporting documents are here

# Example code compilation

These example simply translate the TM Forum specs into Java code using CORBA (MTNM) and WSDL(MTOSI) plugins.
THis is the starting point for creating an interface.

The MTOSI model seems to work but there are problems with the MTNM model generation.
